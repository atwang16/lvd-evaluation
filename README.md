# lvd-evaluation
Source code, evaluation framework, and datasets for "A Comparative Study of Local Visual Descriptors," researched at ESIEE during the summer of 2017.

## How to Use
Datasets are not included in the github repository due to database size, but all databases used in this study  can be publicly downloaded online. A Python utility is provided in the utils folder (`format_database.py`) to rename subdirectories and images in a downloaded database to be compatible with the Python interface files provided in the repository. The datasets used for this study include the following:
- Amsterdam Library of Objects (ALOI)
- Caltech-256 dataset
- DaLI
- HPatches
- Iguazu
- Mikolajczyk et. al.
