# lvd-evaluation
Source code, evaluation framework, and datasets for "A Comparative Study of Local Visual Descriptors," researched at ESIEE during the summer of 2017.

## How to Use

### Database: Naming Conventions
Datasets are not included in the github repository due to database size, but all databases used in this study  can be publicly downloaded online. A Python utility is provided in the utils folder (`format_database.py`) to rename subdirectories and images in a downloaded database to be compatible with the Python interface files provided in the repository. The datasets used for this study include the following:
- Amsterdam Library of Objects (ALOI)
- Caltech-256 dataset
- DaLI
- HPatches
- Iguazu
- Mikolajczyk et. al.

The naming convention and directory structure for image files must be as follows in order for the code to run properly:
```
database
> dat_nnn_sequence
>> dat_nnn_iii.png/jpg/ppm/pgm
>> dat_nnn_iii_ds.csv (auto-generated by descriptor executables)
>> dat_nnn_iii_kp.csv (auto-generated by descriptor executables)
```
where
- "database" is the name of the database, and "dat" is the first three letters of the database
- "sequence" is the name of the image sequence, and "nnn" is a three-digit integer (padded with zeros) associated with each image sequence
- "iii" is the three-digit integer (padded with zeros) associated with each image
- The "ds" suffix marks csv files which contain descriptors for the named image
- The "kp" suffix marks csv files which contain keypoints for the named image

### Extracting Descriptors

The `build_database.py` Python file has been provided to allow for easily extracting keypoints and descriptors for a given local visual descriptor. (to be continued)
